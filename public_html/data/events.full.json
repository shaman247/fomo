We can keep them close through veneration, in which we tell their stories, listen to their favorite songs, or create art in their honor. We can also create memorial dioramas—small altars or shrines to memorialize our beloveds and their lives, so that they can be gone but not forgotten. In this daylong workshop, we will—with guidance and support from death doula Lauren Seeley—create our own memorial dioramas for a dead loved one. We will also learn about the importance of memorializing, honoring those who have gone, and creating in our grief, as well as the history of altars, shrines, and preservation both in public and private spaces.",

    "description": "Insects surround us. They fuel life on Earth through their roles as pollinators, decomposers, predators, and prey, but rarely do we consider the outsize influence they have had on our culture and civilization. Their anatomy and habits inform how we live, work, create art, and innovate. Our world would look very different without insects, not just because they are crucial to our ecosystems, but because they have shaped and inspired so many aspects of what makes us human. IIn this image-filled presentation by entomologist Barrett Klein, we will explore the overt and hidden ways in which our insect neighbors augment and shape our lives.",

    "description": "For centuries, artists and makers have sought to reach beyond the everyday in order to create in communion with the depths of the unconscious, the divine, and the dead. Join Tiffany Hopkins, author of _Beyond: A Living Person’s Guide To The Dead_ , for a seasonal art-making circle that begins with meditation to shift us into a receptive state. We’ll then create in our chosen mediums, and close each session with the opportunity for participants to share outcomes, experiences, and observations.",

    "description": "Join our founder Joanna Ebenstein for a special viewing of _Bowery at Midnight_ with Bela Lugosi (1942), a cult classic crime-horror film starring Bela Lugosi that blends elements of suspense, horror, and noir. Lugosi stars as Dr. Karl Wagner (also known as Professor Brenner), a respected psychology professor by day who operates a Bowery soup kitchen by night. Wagner also leads a criminal gang, using the kitchen to recruit desperate men for robberies and then disposing of them once they’ve served their purpose. The film’s horror twist comes as Wagner’s accomplice (an unhinged doctor) revives these murdered henchmen as zombie-like minions, culminating in a tense and macabre finale.",

    "description": "Winter Solstice, around December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere, is the shortest day of the year — the moment when the sun’s daily arc in the sky is at its lowest. After the solstice, the daylight begins to increase. Because it’s the deepest point of night, many traditions view the Winter Solstice as a time of stillness, introspection, gestation, and mystery. It is also a turning point — the sun’s “rebirth” after the longest, darkest night. Join mythologist and ritualist Dr. Selena Madden for this free, communal ritual — which will involve writing, releasing, candle-lighting, and mythic invocation —to celebrate this special day.",

Isolated mansions, trauma-ridden specters, macabre love, and entrapped women are pervasive archetypes that tune into our hidden fears, cultural anxieties, and forbidden desires. Though primarily associated with fiction, literature, and film, these archetypes also appear in \"true\" stories in American ghost lore. _America’s Most Gothic: Haunted History Stranger Than Fiction_ by Leanna Renee Hieber and Andrea Janes is a tour through the uncanny tales of real people and settings that exude that elusive Gothic vibe. Dim the lights, curl up with a mug of something warming, and discover the history that truly is stranger than fiction in this illustrated talk that's perfect for a dark winter evening.",

This presentation, based on the speaker's forthcoming book _The Doctors’ Riot of 1788: Body Snatching, Bloodletting, and Anatomy in America_ explores a deadly riot in NYC in which the public attacked doctors and anatomy students for stealing bodies from the Trinity Church cemetery. This talk will focus on body snatching in earlier centuries as well as what the speaker calls modernized body snatching in the United States. Participants will be challenged to address the central question: After all this time, why haven’t we found a way to ensure our own dignity after death?",

    "location": "Online",
    "description": "In January 1906, a Swedish artist named Hilma af Klint began to receive requests from spirits during séances to create a series of paintings which would depict the spiritual plane. These spirits—named Amaliel, Gregor, and Ananda—were conveying messages to her from the ‘High Ones’. Af Klint wrote in her notebooks “I am so small, I am so insignificant but the force that flows through me is so powerful that I must go forward.” And in another passage: “The experiments I have undertaken…will astound humanity.” Hilma saw this series of paintings as the most important work of her life. But the nonrepresentational and abstract style of the works was decades ahead of its time. What is the spiritual message of Hilma’s Paintings for the Temple series? And how do we understand the intersection between spirituality and art? That is the ambitious purpose of this presentation.",

Though famed in myth for her beauty, it wasn’t until the sculptor Praxiteles broke tradition that the female nude was fully embraced in Greek art.

    "location": "Online",
    "description": "The fear of our bodies as mutating, monstrous death traps is a cultural obsession with a lineage stretching back far further than Cronenberg. Plato called the body a tomb and a prison, Medieval Christians likened it to a sack of worms; while the Buddha is said to have urged his followers to scorn it as a diseased mass of wounds. Simultaneously, women have been categorized as the corporeal class, more fleshly – and more _deathly_ – than the male. Why has the horrific body been women's burden to bear, and how has the charge of female bodiliness been used to justify social inequality, exploitation, and violence? This talk will offer a radical feminist dissection of the body horror that plagues manmade culture, of men's immortal dreams of disincarnation and their bloodyminded nightmares of carnal womanhood.",

This tradition of radical self-invention—seen in icons like Klaus Nomi, Divine, and the Club Kids—celebrates the bizarre and the beautiful, turning nightlife into a stage for personal and artistic liberation. With wild costumes, bold personas, and a spirit of defiance, these scenes invite us to break free from convention and embrace our most creative selves. Join artist Le Pustra for a lively discussion on the transformative power of alter egos in nightlife and cabaret, and hear about his own evolution from outsider to living work of art.",
